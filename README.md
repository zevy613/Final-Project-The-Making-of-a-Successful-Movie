# Project 3 Part 1
 
Business Problem
For this project, you have been hired to produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, you will use this database to analyze what makes a movie successful and will provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.
Over the course of this project, you will:
•	Part 1: Download several files from IMDB’s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.
•	Part 2: Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.
•	Part 3: Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.
•	Part 4: Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.
•	Part 5 (Optional): Produce a Linear Regression model to predict movie performance.
